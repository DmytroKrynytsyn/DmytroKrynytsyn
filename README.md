# üë®‚Äçüíº Dmytro Krynytsyn, PhD  

I am a **Backend Architect**, **Data Engineering Specialist**, and **Infrastructure Expert** with over a decade of experience designing, implementing, and scaling **highly reliable backend systems and data pipelines**.  
My core focus is on **backend architecture**, **high availability (HA)**, **scalability**, **cost-optimized cloud infrastructure** (FinOps), and **data engineering solutions** tailored to enterprise needs.  

I specialize in building **cloud-native distributed systems** and **data pipelines** that are efficient, fault-tolerant, and capable of handling complex, large-scale workloads.
