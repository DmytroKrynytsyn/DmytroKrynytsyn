# üë®‚Äçüíº Dmytro Krynytsyn, PhD  

I am a **Backend Architect**, **Data Engineering Specialist**, and **Infrastructure Expert** with over a decade of experience designing, implementing, and scaling **highly reliable backend systems and data pipelines**.  
My core focus is on **backend architecture**, **high availability (HA)**, **scalability**, **cost-optimized cloud infrastructure** (FinOps), and **data engineering solutions** tailored to enterprise needs.  

I specialize in building **cloud-native distributed systems** and **data pipelines** that are efficient, fault-tolerant, and capable of handling complex, large-scale workloads.

## üìÇ Explore My Work  

Here are some highlighted projects showcasing my expertise in backend architecture, infrastructure, and cloud-native solutions:  

### 1. [**LLM RAG - Milvus and Slack**](https://github.com/DmytroKrynytsyn/rag1)  
A project integrating Milvus, Slack API, and LangChain to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for knowledge management. This showcases the use of Python, FastAPI, and modern cloud technologies like AWS, Docker, and Terraform for scalable and efficient backend solutions.  

---

### 2. [**Linux Server Monitoring: Grafana + Prometheus**](https://github.com/DmytroKrynytsyn/metrics1)  
Built a robust server monitoring system using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. The project employs AWS cloud infrastructure with Docker, Terraform, and Ansible for configuration and automation.  

---

### 3. [**EFK Stack on AWS with Terraform & Ansible**](https://github.com/DmytroKrynytsyn/logs1)  
Implemented a centralized log management system using the EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) stack to efficiently handle large-scale infrastructure logs. This project demonstrates an enterprise-grade architecture automated via AWS, Terraform, and Ansible, showcasing the advantages of EFK over the traditional ELK stack.  

---

### 4. [**Redis Cluster, High Availability (HA) Architecture**](https://github.com/DmytroKrynytsyn/redis_cluster)  
Designed and configured a Redis cluster with master-slave architecture to meet high availability (HA) and scalability requirements. The project highlights the use of Terraform, Terragrunt, and modular Ansible roles for provisioning and automation, ensuring fault tolerance and reliability.  

---

### 5. [**Kafka Cluster, High Availability (HA) Architecture (KRaft Mode)**](https://github.com/DmytroKrynytsyn/kafka_cluster)  
Provisioned and configured a Kafka cluster running in KRaft Mode (Raft Protocol) to eliminate Zookeeper dependency. This architecture is tailored for enterprise-grade reliability, leveraging Terraform, Terragrunt, and Ansible for automation while maintaining modular and reusable infrastructure configurations.  

---

### 6. [**Multi-Master Kubernetes Cluster on AWS**](https://github.com/DmytroKrynytsyn/devops/tree/master/kcluster)  
Deployed a multi-master Kubernetes cluster on AWS to ensure fault tolerance and scalability for high-availability workloads. The project integrates Terraform, Ansible, and Ansible Dynamic Inventory to streamline infrastructure management and automation.
